## Building

Compiled with MiKTeX (`pdflatex` + `bibtex`). Four passes are needed because the
document uses `natbib` and `longtable`:

```bash
pdflatex main && bibtex main && pdflatex main && pdflatex main
```

or, if `latexmk` is installed:

```bash
latexmk -pdf main.tex
```

Packages used: `amsmath`, `amssymb`, `textcomp`, `geometry`, `microtype`, `booktabs`,
`longtable`, `tabularx`, `array`, `multirow`, `graphicx`, `xcolor` (with the `table`
option), `enumitem`, `listings`, `fancyhdr`, `titlesec`, `caption`, `natbib`,
`hyperref`.

Last build: **17 pages**, no undefined references or citations.

The document was condensed from an earlier 37-page draft. Content was compressed, not
dropped: all fourteen techniques, all eleven requirements, the full architecture, the
package register, the phase plan and the source provenance are retained in shorter form.
What was removed is per-technique commercial-practice narrative, the full renderer
comparison table (now a prose paragraph), the per-file source-provenance table (now a
paragraph) and the expanded literature positioning.

## Output

`main.pdf` is the compiled document. A copy is published at the project root as
`../DTaaS-Visualisation-Layer.pdf`. That PDF is now generated from these sources —
earlier drafts used a separate HTML-to-PDF route, which has been removed so the sources
and the PDF cannot diverge.

Build intermediates (`*.aux`, `*.log`, `*.bbl`, `*.blg`, `*.out`, `*.toc`) are not
kept in the repository.
