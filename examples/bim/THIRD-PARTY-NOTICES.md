# Third Party Notices

This package redistributes third party code in binary form. The notices below
are required by the licences of that code and are shipped inside the published
tarball, so a recipient has them without going back to the repository.

## web-ifc

- Version: 0.0.77
- Licence: Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2.0)
- Source: <https://github.com/ThatOpen/engine_web-ifc>
- Licence text: <https://github.com/ThatOpen/engine_web-ifc/blob/main/LICENSE>

`src/converter/generated/wasm.ts` embeds `web-ifc.wasm` from that release,
unmodified, encoded as base64 (`scripts/inline-wasm.mjs` generates it from the
installed `web-ifc` package before every build). It is inlined so that a
consumer installs one package and serves no extra file, which is what lets
the conversion run in the browser of whoever is looking at the model. tsup
bundles the constant into one of the content-hashed `dist/chunk-*.js` files
alongside the code that uses it, rather than into a fixed path; the
declaration alone stays at `dist/converter/generated/wasm.d.ts`.

MPL-2.0 is a file level licence. It covers `web-ifc.wasm` and the files it was
built from, and it does not extend to this package's own source, which stays
under the licence in `LICENSE.md`. Section 3.2 requires that the Source Code
Form be available to anyone who receives the Executable Form: it is, at the
address above, and this package makes no modification to it.

No other third party code is redistributed here. `three` and `web-ifc` are
regular dependencies of this package, resolved and installed by the consumer's
package manager from their own registries; neither one's source is copied
into this tarball.
