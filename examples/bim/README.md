# 🏢 bim-example

`@into-cps-association/bim-example` ports **bim-kit 0.1.1** onto the
[DTaaS SDK](../../README.md) contract: IFC-to-GLB conversion, a three.js
scene, a React building browser, and the `bim` `DtaasExtension` that plugs
the whole thing into a DTaaS host.

It is a standalone, private package (not published) that exercises the SDK
the way a real domain kit would — its own `package.json`, build, tests and CI
job, with the SDK installed the same way any consumer installs it: packed and
added, never as a workspace symlink.

## 📦 Setup

```bash
# once, at the repository root
yarn install

# then, in examples/bim
yarn install
yarn sdk   # builds the SDK root, packs it and installs the tarball here
```

`yarn sdk` (`scripts/install-sdk.mjs`) is what makes
`@into-cps-association/dtaas-sdk` resolvable during development. Run it again
after pulling in SDK changes.

## 🧭 URL scheme

The extension mounts at `/bim`:

- `/bim` — the models list for the fallback (or `?dir=`) folder.
- `/bim/models/<name>?dir=<folder>` — a chosen model in a folder.

The folder shown, in order: the `?dir=` query parameter, then the
`REACT_APP_EXT_BIM_MODELS_DIRECTORY` extension setting, then the host's
`library.conventions.modelsDirectory` default. An invalid `?dir=` (one that
could leave the library) shows an alert and fetches nothing.

Selecting a model navigates to `/bim/models/<name>?dir=<dir>`; changing the
folder navigates to `/bim?dir=<folder>` and resets the chosen model.
Switching models hides the toolbar and side panels until the new viewer is
ready.

## ⚠️ SDK gaps this package works around

- **`ScopeContext` carries no element properties.** The `bim.room` and
  `bim.storey` scopes need to group elements by room and storey, but the
  scene's glTF `extras` alone (`globalId`, `ifcClass`, `predefinedType`) does
  not carry that. Both scopes assume the `aec` substrate copies room and
  storey onto each element's `userData` from the property tree; elements
  with neither are omitted.
- **`FieldKernel(samples, grid)` carries no geometry.** bim-kit's flood fill
  needs wall geometry to stop the fill at, which the kernel does not carry,
  so this package ships no `fieldKernels`.

## 🔀 Departures from bim-kit 0.1.1

Full list in [design §6](../../docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-28-bim-example-design.md#6-departures-from-bim-kit-011); in short:

- `BuildingModels`: `directory` is now required; selection is controllable
  (`selected?`, `onSelect?`, uncontrolled behaviour unchanged); an unknown
  `selected` shows `No model named <name> in <directory>`; `MODELS_DIRECTORY`
  is removed.
- New `onBindingsChange?(bindings)` and `list?(directory)` on
  `BuildingModels` (falls back to `contentsUrl` when `list` is absent, as
  0.1.1 did).
- New `DirectoryPicker({ list, value, onChange })`, independent of DTaaS.
- New `core/libraryPath.normaliseLibraryPath(raw)`.
- New `schema/migrate.manifestToVisualisation(manifest, { name, brokerUrl })`.
- `exportGlb` extracted from `BimCanvas` so the converter can reuse it.
