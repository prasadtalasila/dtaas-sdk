/**
 * Reading a loaded glTF scene as the binding resolver wants to see it.

 * only file in the route that knows both sides.
 *
 * A GLB written by the converter carries `globalId` in glTF `extras` on
 * every node, which is where the identity comes from. The binding key is the
 * IFC GlobalId, because it survives a re-export and a mesh name does not.
