/**
 * Turning converted IFC geometry into something three.js can draw.
 *
 * The converter returns plain typed arrays and imports no renderer, which is
 * what lets it be tested where there is no canvas. This is the small adapter
 * that meets it, and it is the only file that knows both sides.
 *
 * The result is shaped like a loaded GLB on purpose: one mesh per object, the
 * GlobalId in `userData`, all under one group. A viewer must not be able to
 * tell whether it is looking at geometry converted a moment ago or geometry
 * read from a file, because the same code has to work with both.
