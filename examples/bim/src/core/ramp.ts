/**
 * Turning a reading into a colour.
 *
 * Blue to red is the convention for temperature, and also the pair most often
 * confused by the commonest form of colour blindness. So the ramp runs
 * through a light middle: cold is a deep blue, warm is an orange, and the two
 * ends differ in lightness as well as in hue, so the order survives greyscale.
 *
 * Returns a plain 24 bit number, which three.js, CSS and a canvas all accept,
 * so this file needs no renderer and no colour library.
