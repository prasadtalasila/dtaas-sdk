/**
 * Working out where the floors of a building actually are.

 * then cannot disagree, because they are the same measurement.
 *
 * Nothing here imports a renderer. A caller supplies the base height of each
 * object and which storey the model assigns it, which is a few numbers, and
 * gets back the bands, which is what lets this be tested without a canvas.
