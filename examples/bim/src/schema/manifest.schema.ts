/**
 * The binding manifest, as a schema.
 *
 * This is step 1 of the sequence DTaaS issue 1762 proposes, and it comes
 * first for the reason the issue gives: the manifest is the load-bearing
 * piece, and if its schema is right the conversion, the viewer and the
 * transport can each be replaced without touching the others.
 *
 * Nothing here renders anything or imports three.js. That is deliberate. The
 * client's unit tests run in jsdom, where WebGL, workers and WASM do not
 * exist, so anything that can be tested without a canvas is kept where it
 * can be.
 *
 * A manifest is written by a person and will frequently be wrong. The errors
 * this produces name the binding and the field, because "invalid manifest" on
 * a file with forty bindings is not a message anyone can act on.
